# allwinner_v3s_testBoard
Test project based on the Allwinner V3S SOC

The project will contain a basic board with power supplies and ethernet.
Most of the digital IO is exposed on the board edge as 2.54mm headers
SD0 interface is used for boot.

The "buildroot" folder contais all the required files and instructions to build a bare system.

Please keep in mind that the board is build around my requirements.
